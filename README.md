Breakout game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 Canvas.

• Your game should have a single screen with 8 rows of bricks, a paddle, and a ball.  <br>
• If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’. <br>
• After 5 lives, the game is over.  <br>
• Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.  <br>
• The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right edges of the screen.
